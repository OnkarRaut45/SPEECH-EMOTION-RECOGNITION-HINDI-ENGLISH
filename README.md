# SPEECH-EMOTION-RECOGNITION-HINDI-ENGLISH
Detection of human emotions through voice-pattern and speech-pattern analysis has many applications such as better assisting human-machine interactions. In particular, we worked on classification models of emotions elicited by speeches based on deep neural networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Classification based on acoustic features such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC). The models have been trained to classify three different emotions (happy, sad, angry). These 3 emotions will be identified using Hindi audio dataset extracted from Bollywood movies/series.
